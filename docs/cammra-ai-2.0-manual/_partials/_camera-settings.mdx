| **Autofocus** | Set area to cover license plate, fine-tune manually |
| **Wide Dynamic Range** | **Disabled** |
| **Contrast** | 65 |
| **Local Contrast** | 65 |
| **Tone Mapping** | 20 |
| **IR-Cut Filter** | Auto |
| **Max Shutter** | 1/500 (daytime), 1/1000 (nighttime for headlight glare) |

### Resolution Recommendations

| Lanes | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| One lane | Full HD (1920x1080) |
| Two lanes (NA/GCC plates) | 4K (3840x2160) |
| Two lanes (EU/SA plates) | Full HD (1920x1080) |

### Additional Recommendations

#### IR LEDs for Nighttime Operation
Ensure the camera is equipped with IR LEDs for nighttime license plate recognition.

#### Shutter Speed
Set shutter speed high enough to suppress glare from vehicle headlights at night. **1/1000** is typically recommended.

:::caution
Excessively high shutter speeds may blur fine details like character edges on license plates.
:::

#### Sunlight Considerations
When selecting mounting location, consider sunrise and sunset angles. Direct sunlight can significantly distort the image.

#### Pole Stability
If mounted on a roadside pole, verify stability under real traffic conditions. Some poles vibrate when heavy vehicles pass.

#### Day/Night Verification
Always verify performance at night after optimizing daytime settings, and vice versa.

:::warning Night Mode Limitation
At night, when the camera switches to black-and-white mode, Make/Model Recognition (MMR) and color detection are disabled.
