CAMMRA AI is an advanced application developed for Axis cameras with ARTPEC-8 and ARTPEC-9 processors. Leveraging the capabilities of the ACAP (Axis Camera Application Platform) and DLPU (Deep Learning Processing Unit), it runs several neural networks in parallel on board these cameras.

### Key Features

- **License Plate Recognition (LPR)** - Front and rear view recognition
- **Vehicle Make, Model, Color Recognition (MMR)** - AI-powered vehicle identification
- **Vehicle Type Detection** - Car, truck, motorcycle, bus, etc.
- **No-Plate Detection** - Detect vehicles without visible license plates
- **Speed Measurement** - Integration with Axis radar (DLE cameras)
- **Sound Measurement** - Integration with Sorama units for vehicle loudness

### Use Cases

- City and highway traffic monitoring
- Law enforcement and stolen vehicle tracking
- Access control and parking management
- Traffic statistics and analytics
- Mobile installation in vehicles

### Integrations

CAMMRA AI integrates with:
- **FF DataFactory** - Data fusion platform for centralized meta-data
- **Video Management Systems** - Via VAPIX events
- **Law Enforcement Databases** - Safercities (NZ), SNIPR/Platform 1 (SA), Fusus, Auror
- **National Databases** - Belgium, UK, Australia via Macq M3 and Jenoptik
- **Access Control Systems** - Genetec, 2N, barrier controllers

:::tip Server-less Architecture
The solution is fully server-less - all analytics are performed on-edge using camera processing power.
