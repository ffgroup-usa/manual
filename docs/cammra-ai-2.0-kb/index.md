# CAMMRA AI 2.0

CAMMRA AI is an AI-based data fusion application for vehicle data recognition.

CAMMRA AI is an advanced application developed for Axis cameras with **Artpec 8 and 9 processors**, leveraging the capabilities of the ACAP (Axis Camera Application Platform) and DLPU (Deep learning processing unit), which allows it to run several neural networks in parallel on board these cameras.

## Key Features

- **License Plate Recognition** - Accurate LPR for multiple regions worldwide
- **Make, Model & Color** - Vehicle classification and identification
- **No-Plate Detection** - Detect vehicles without visible license plates
- **Multi-lane Support** - Handle higher speeds and multiple lanes
- **4K Resolution Support** - Enhanced recognition at 4K resolution
- **Edge Processing** - Fully server-less, analytics done on camera
- **Open API Integration** - Seamless connection with other systems

## What's New in 2.0

- **Artpec 9 Support** - Extended processor compatibility
- **4K Resolution** - Higher resolution support for improved accuracy
- **Enhanced Plate Detection** - Updated minimum plate size requirements
- **Vehicle Detection Without Plates** - Detect and classify vehicles even without visible plates
- **Improved Intersection Support** - Better handling of non-traditional LPR scenarios

## Use Cases

With CAMMRA AI, users can conveniently consolidate all essential traffic data within a single application:

- Traffic monitoring on city and highway roads
- Law enforcement and stolen vehicle tracking
- Parking and access control
- Statistical traffic analysis
- Mobile installation in vehicles
- Intersection monitoring

## Integration Options

- **FF DataFactory** - Data fusion platform for centralized meta-data
- **VMS Systems** - Genetec Security Center, Milestone, etc.
- **Law Enforcement** - Safercities (NZ), SNIPR (SA), Fusus, Auror
- **National Databases** - Macq M3, Jenoptik integrations
