# Camera Mounting Recommendations

## Camera Mounting Angle

The ideal camera's mounting angle is **30°**.

This ensures that the camera captures the desired field of view without excessive tilting, which can affect the accuracy of the captured data.

## Horizontal License Plate Alignment

It is crucial to align the license plate image horizontally within the camera's field of view.

The license plate should not be tilted more than **10° horizontally**.

If the image appears tilted beyond this threshold, it is recommended to adjust the camera's position so that the license plate appears horizontally in the live stream.
