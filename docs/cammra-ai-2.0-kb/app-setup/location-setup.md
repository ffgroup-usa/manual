Correct regional settings will help CAMMRA AI application classify captured license plates.

1. **Region:** Choose the supported LPR regions based on your deployment location.  
   CAMMRA AI works in various regions of Europe (including Turkey and Israel), South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and North America.

   Available regions:
   - Europe
   - North America
   - South America
   - USA
   - Mexico
   - Canada
   - GCC
   - Indonesia
   - Australia
   - New Zealand
   - Taiwan
   - Vietnam
   - Hong Kong
   - South Africa

   Other regions may only have license plate recognition for specific libraries.

2. **Preferred Country:** Select country where the camera is located.

3. **Preferred State** (for USA, Canada, Mexico): Select state where the camera is located.

:::note
Preferred country and state selection will not limit recognition to the license plates of that country or state, but will help the algorithm to classify captured plates more accurately.
