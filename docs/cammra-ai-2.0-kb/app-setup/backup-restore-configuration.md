# Backup & Restore Configuration

To create a safe backup of all your CAMMRA AI application settings, including license, use the "Backup configuration" feature.

This will create a file storing all the settings that you can save at preferred location and then use it to restore in the application.

![Maintenance Section](./img/backup-restore-1.png)

The Maintenance section provides three main options:

- **Backup configuration** - Creates a backup file of all settings
- **Restore configuration** - Restores settings from a previously saved backup file
- **Clear all recognition results** - Removes all stored recognition data
