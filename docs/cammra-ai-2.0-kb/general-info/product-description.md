![CAMMRA AI Overview](../img/product-description-1-cr.png)

CAMMRA AI is an AI-based data fusion application for vehicle data recognition.

CAMMRA AI is an advanced application developed for Axis cameras with Artpec 8 and 9 processor. Leveraging the capabilities of the ACAP (Axis Camera Application Platform) and DLPU (Deep learning processing unit) allows it to run several neural networks in parallel on board these cameras.

With CAMMRA AI, users can conveniently consolidate all essential traffic data within a single application. Administrators gain complete control over traffic flows by strategically installing the cameras on roads leading to and from the city. The app is also ready for mobile installation in vehicles. CAMMRA AI is a perfect sensor for tracking stolen cars, providing data for law enforcement purposes, and generating statistical analyses.

Integrating CAMMRA AI with Axis cameras transforms them into powerful traffic sensors capable of gathering vehicle information such as make, model, color, type, and license plate - both from front and rear view. This comprehensive data collection makes CAMMRA AI the ultimate solution for monitoring city and highway traffic.

CAMMRA AI also has the ability to detect vehicles without license plates, delivering detailed information such as vehicle make, model, color, and type.

Moreover, compared to other ACAP solutions and previous generations of the app (CAMMRA), speed measurement from radar (Axis) and sound localization and measurement (Sorama) are possible to be added on top of above mentioned parameters. With CAMMRA AI running on DLE video-fusion cameras, the vehicle data are enriched by vehicle speed (in km/h or mph) and if installed together with Sorama L642V units, vehicle loudness (in dbA) is attached to every vehicle event.
There is dedicated part of our Customer hub to these solutions [here](https://customerhub.ff-group.ai/portal/en/kb/solutions).

CAMMRA AI is specifically designed to handle higher speeds and multiple lanes or less traditional LPR scenarios like intersections, making it suitable for a wide range of traffic scenarios. The application offers seamless integration through an open API, allowing users to connect and integrate with other systems effortlessly. The primary option for integration is FF DataFactory - a data fusion platform from FF Group, which is a unique place to centralize meta-data from even hundreds of cameras equipped with CAMMRA AI, CAMMRA or Axis License Plate Verifier apps. Moreover, it provides valuable traffic insights and receives also other data to correlate with vehicle information.

Additionally, CAMMRA AI's meta-data has already been integrated with regional law enforcement databases like Safercities (New Zealand) SNIPR/Platform 1 (South Africa), Fusus, Auror and thanks to Macq M3 and Jenoptik integrations meta-data from CAMMRA AI can be sent to national databases in Belgium, UK and Australia. This ensures compatibility and interoperability with existing infrastructure.

The solution is fully server-less, all the analytics are done on edge using camera processing power.
