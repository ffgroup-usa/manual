:::note
5MP cameras support CAMMRA AI in Full HD mode only, and 4K cameras support 4K in BETA mode only.
:::

## Additional Information

Pixel density, achieved with 4K camera resolution for EU + South African plates, allows capturing the width of three lanes. However, due to the limited performance of the IR backlight during nighttime, installation for covering three-lane traffic is not recommended.

:::note Sensor Selection
CAMMRA AI works with default camera sensor #1 as video source, except P1518-E and P1518-LE cameras, where sensor #1 is used for wide-angle scene view, so CAMMRA AI utilizes sensor #2.
