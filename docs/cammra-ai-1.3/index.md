# CAMMRA AI 1.3

CAMMRA AI is an AI-based data fusion application for vehicle data recognition.

CAMMRA is an advanced application developed for Axis cameras with Artpec 8 processor only, leveraging the capabilities of the ACAP (Axis Camera Application Platform) and DLPU (Deep learning processing unit), which allows it to run several neural networks in parallel on board of these cameras.

## Key Features

- **License Plate Recognition** - Accurate LPR for multiple regions worldwide
- **Make, Model & Color** - Vehicle classification and identification
- **Multi-lane Support** - Handle higher speeds and multiple lanes
- **Edge Processing** - Fully server-less, analytics done on camera
- **Open API Integration** - Seamless connection with other systems

## Use Cases

With CAMMRA AI, users can conveniently consolidate all essential traffic data within a single application:

- Traffic monitoring on city and highway roads
- Law enforcement and stolen vehicle tracking
- Parking and access control
- Statistical traffic analysis
- Mobile installation in vehicles

## Integration Options

- **FF DataFactory** - Data fusion platform for centralized meta-data
- **VMS Systems** - Genetec Security Center, Milestone, etc.
- **Law Enforcement** - Safercities (NZ), SNIPR (SA), Fusus, Auror
- **National Databases** - Macq M3, Jenoptik integrations
